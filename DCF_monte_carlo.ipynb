Using these, I ran regressions to obtain the beta for each peer and took their average as the industry levered beta.\n",

    "- $\\bold{\\text{Step 3:}}$ The first column of the dataframe is taken as the base column.\n",
    "- $\\bold{\\text{Step 4:}}$ First the forecast of EBIT is generated as the EBIT of the previous period multiplied by the intrinsic growth rate\n",
    "- $\\bold{\\text{Step 5:}}$ Second post tax EBIT is generated by multiplying the forecasted EBIT by (1 - tax_rate)\n",
    "- $\\bold{\\text{Step 6:}}$ Mid-year convention is used assuming cashflow happens first in the 6th month of the FY and then at the end of the FY\n",
    "- $\\bold{\\text{Step 7:}}$ Discount factor for a particlar year is calculated as the $\\frac{1}{(1+wacc)}$ raised to mid-year convention value of the particular year.\n",
    "- $\\bold{\\text{Step 8:}}$ FCFF is forecasted as the product of post tax EBIT and (1- reinvestment rate).\n",
    "- $\\bold{\\text{Step 9:}}$ PV of the forecasted cashflow is generated by multiplying the cashflow by the discount factor that year.\n",
    "- $\\bold{\\text{Step 10:}}$ Terminal value of the firm is calculated by multiplying the final year forecasted FCFF multiplying by the intrinsic growth rate and discounting this by dividing by (growth_rate - terminal growth for the firm.) For Dixon, terminal growth rate is assumed to be 15%.\n",
    "- $\\bold{\\text{Step 10:}}$ Value of operating assets for the firm is calculated as : Terminal_value + PV of FCFF\n",
